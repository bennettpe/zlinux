User screipts to get iso, create install directory, create initrd

Check for sudo execution of script or warn user
Ask user to run newly installed zLinux system
auto-tune hercules.cnf

check if iso was really downloaded before attempting to mount it
made 3GB vs 9GB more permissive in selection
added cleanup_after_successful_install.bash script to make cleaning up easy
if not wget then use curl
deal with file permissions
more sanity checks (for example see if install/ dir has content etc.)

multiple times)
