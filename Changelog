v 0.2 
-----
use our own supplied Hercules version
User screipts to get iso, create install directory, create initrd
Put hercules.cnf in assets and swap after finished install
Check for sudo execution of script or warn user
Ask user to run newly installed zLinux system
auto-tune hercules.cnf
run sanity checks for DASD size selection
check if iso was really downloaded before attempting to mount it
made 3GB vs 9GB more permissive in selection
added cleanup_after_successful_install.bash script to make cleaning up easy
if not wget then use curl
deal with file permissions
more sanity checks (for example see if install/ dir has content etc.)
don't get ISO if we have it already (somebody could rerun the procedure
multiple times)
don't aloow user to be root
