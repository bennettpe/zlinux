v 0.2
-----
use our own supplied Hercules version
Use scripts to get iso, create install directory, create initrd
Put hercules.cnf in assets and swap after finished install
Check for sudo execution of script or warn user
Ask user to run newly installed zLinux system
auto-tune hercules.cnf
run sanity checks for DASD size selection
check if iso was really downloaded before attempting to mount it
made 3GB vs 9GB more permissive in selection
added cleanup_after_successful_install.bash script to make cleaning up easy
if not wget then use curl
deal with file permissions
more sanity checks (for example see if install/ dir has content etc.)
don't get ISO if we have it already (somebody could rerun the procedure
multiple times)
don't allow user to be root


v 0.3
-----
Made tuning logic more streamlined
Same for RAM tuning
created run_zlinux script to run Ubuntu and setup NAT and tunneling
Expanded README
made dasd/ and logs/ directory non-empty to make it compatible with git
Made assets/hercules.rc.hd0 able to shutdown
created run_zlinux.bash script to set up environment and start zLinux
Fixed tuning for the nth+1 time...


v 0.4
-----
Removed option to start freshly installed Ubuntu from install script
create dasd/ and logs/ if they don't exist
fixed small stuff in run_zlinux.bash
Updated hercules.cnf for FACILITY instead of ARCHLVL
updated hercules.rc.hd0
fixed ipl.rc
export HERCULES_RC properly
auto-tune now finally works. It's been only 3 weeks fiddling with it...
set assets/ to non-writable


v 0.5 (most  by Racingmars)
-------------------------
General script cleanup and fixes
Fix RAM auto-tune
Offer 27GB (3390-27) disk type; improve DASD creation
Switch to template-based preseed and hercules.cnf creation. Only create config
during initial installation; don't overwrite user changes on future runs
Fix wget/curl detection; improvements to ISO download and mount
Use a Hercules built with ./herc4x/lib and ./herc4x/lib/hercules runpath;
include build script for reference
Run as regular user, not with sudo or as root. Run specific commands with sudo
Detect installation success
Only make one log file per script per run
Don't remove write permissions on anything -- we want user to be able to
easily rm this entire directory without trouble if they want to
Mark apparent success or failure of Ubuntu automated install process
Enahnced hercules console automation 
logs have proper time stamps in file name now
check if enough disk space exists before allocating DASD

v 0.6
-----
Check for net-tools availability; the set_network script needs it
Check if if the scripts are being executed from zlinux/
